Link external library optionally
--------------------------------

This example shows linking an external library to an executable. One can 
directly compile the code without linking the external library by
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make

One should firstly compile the external library in `ThirdParty` then compile 
the code if tries to use the external library. Instruction is given in 
`ThirdParty`. Back to this folder and compile the code with the external library
by 
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake .. -DUSE_MYMATH=on
$ make
